# optimized-ml-compiler

## Purpose of this Repo

The purpose of this repo is to really understand how model run. In university I learnt how to build models and how to evaluate models but I have no idea how a computer will actually run a model. This repo is setup to create a model compuiler with the intention of (1) learning how running a model actually works and (2) ways to make this runtime compiler more efficient. 

## ML Model Compiler Design 



### Example ONNX File 

This repo will utilize a number of example ONNX ML model files to test it's infrastructure. The first ONNX file has version 1.1 of AlexNet a CNN model for image classification. Unfortunately the file is 250MB, which although is small it's too large to commit to GitHub.
